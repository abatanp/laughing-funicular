Project Description:
Blossom Bank also known as BB PLC is a multinational financial services group, that offers retail and investment banking, pension management, asset management and payments services, which has its headquarters in London, UK.

It is no doubt that Blossom Bank is still and will keep experiencing fraudulent transactions which leads us to building a Machine Learning model to predict these transactions as well as putting a stop to it so that fraudulent transactions can be brought down to zero.

Steps taken during this project:
- Visualizing the relationships of the columns within the dataset (EDA).
- Finding out what Machine Learning (ML) Model will detect frauds better.
- Optimization of the ML Model.

Challenges:
My challenges were errors.
I keep getting errors whenever a syntax is wrong.
I also made references to previous projects of similar nature before getting the project done.
